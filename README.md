📱 Development Guidelines
Responsive Design Best Practices
Mobile First: Always design for mobile screens first

Touch Targets: Ensure interactive elements are at least 44px

Content Strategy: Prioritize content hierarchy across breakpoints

Performance: Optimize images and lazy load content

Testing: Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools

Code Standards
Use TypeScript for type safety

Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)

Implement proper error boundaries

Use semantic HTML elements

Maintain consistent naming conventions

🚀 Build and Deployment
Production Build
bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Start production server locally
npm start
Environment Variables
Create appropriate environment files:

.env.local - Local development

.env.production - Production environment

Deployment Options
Vercel: Seamless deployment for Next.js applications

Netlify: JAMstack deployment platform

Docker: Containerized deployment

Traditional hosting: Build static files with npm run build

🧪 Testing
bash
